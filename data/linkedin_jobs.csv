When students head into a live classroom, they will feel like it is a regular school day – teachers asking questions, students raising their hands, all made possible by our technology and teachers. Elevate LIVE teaching was built to act, look, feel, and sound like every other classroom.

Every classroom has a Classroom Coach – the adult in the room to help with classroom management, keeping kids on task, and partnering together with the teacher. Our technology platform was built for K-12 students to facilitate effective, engaging instruction. We also have a 24/7 support network for teachers and schools if issues arise.

Benefits To Teaching With Elevate...


Our teaching network allows teachers to teach on their own terms! This means part-time hours on schedules you create and the ability to work from home (or any other professional setting). We take away many of the excess burdens that teachers typically shoulder (no more lunch duty) and provide teachers with an engaging curriculum (through Elevate or our district partners), a supportive team, and a tech platform that empowers teachers to focus on teaching. 
Fully remote (private and professional setting required) 
Part-time hours during the regular school day (choose your own schedule) 
Reduced administrative duties (no staff meetings or lunch duties) 
Individualized instructional coaching to hone teaching skills 
Professional development opportunities 
Networking and fun with your fellow teachers!

Commitment and consistency in attendance - Elevate teachers are the teacher of record for their students 
Maintain an elevated level of professionalism in the classroom environment with students, the Classroom Coach, fellow Elevate K-12 professionals, and school employees 
Flexible, can think critically, and can adapt to change quickly to ensure optimal student outcomes 
Ability to meet deadlines set by Elevate and the school calendar 
Tech-savvy and comfortable operating in a remote setting 
Can maintain an elevated level of online organizational and professional skills

An active, verifiable Math teaching certification in the United States
Experience teaching students in grades 3 - 8
Must currently reside in the United States
A bachelor's degree from an accredited university or college 
A daily available time block of at least three consecutive hours, Monday through Friday, 8am - 4pm EST. 
Ability to work a part-time schedule of 10-20 hours per week during normal school hours 
A laptop or desktop computer with a reliable high-speed internet connection 


At Elevate, we treat teachers like the educated professionals they are. We empower our network of teachers to choose which classes they want to teach, when (and how much) they want to work, and where they want to log in – while being empowered to teach LIVE in classrooms across the country. Become an Elevate teacher, and finally take control of your work/life harmony!

Elevate K-12 is a creative, challenging, and adventurous network where individuals and teams are driven by growth, collaboration, and the goal to constantly focus on our students' needs. But through all of this, we always remember why we’re here: to teach!

About The Job
Depart On

January 11, 2026 

Duration

2 years, plus 3 months training 

ELIGIBILITY: Must be at least 18 years of age. Must be a U.S. citizen.

Project description

Akwaaba! (Welcome!) Volunteers in Ghana will serve in a stable democracy with a rich history and hospitable and diverse cultures. Ghana recognizes over 70 languages and tribes throughout the sixteen regions, all of whom co-exist harmoniously. Welcoming visitors is a point of cultural identity. Hosting visitors is the ultimate expression of Ghanaian culture. Acknowledging the presence of another human being by greeting them, honors their existence. In the local communities, visitors will be welcomed into families and quickly be made to feel at home. Ghana is Peace Corps’ oldest post, hosting volunteers since the Agency’s first cohort departed in 1961.

Skills

The goal of the Education project is for students to gain skills in math, science, and art to advance in their academic careers. Volunteers in the education sector will work collaboratively with counterparts and the communities to increase:


 Achievement of students in STEAM (science, math, and/or art).
 Students’ literacy skills.
 The ability of community members to support students’ access to learning.
 Capacity of teachers to use girls' empowerment practices in the classroom.


Volunteer work will directly contribute to filling an educational gap in rural and urban schools. Peace Corps Volunteers will teach alongside teachers in rural communities to provide the essential skills in Math and Science. You will learn how to integrate literacy learning into math and science lessons to support English literacy skills development that help bring students up to grade level.

Teachers teach on average 24 periods per week. Each period lasts 45 minutes and each grade is expected to receive an average of 45 periods of instruction a week covering all subjects (nine periods a day for all subjects). Class sizes range from about 20 students to 45 or more. Students' ages can range from 12 to 23 years old. You will be responsible for teaching the subject assigned to you, developing lesson plans, teaching classes, giving assignments, grading homework and tests, and assisting students outside of the classroom.

Peace Corps/Ghana promotes girls’ education and empowerment. You will receive training on challenges in Ghana and you will have the opportunity to implement activities that are contextually appropriate. During your service, you will look for ways to work with community members to increase girls’ sense of agency. As part of your work, you will also report on these efforts and their impact. Volunteers receive training on how to tell success stories and report numeric/statistical data to Peace Corps."

About AI4ALL

AI4ALL is a national nonprofit that is transforming the pipeline of AI practitioners and creating a more inclusive, human-centered discipline. We empower students to be AI Changemakers by cultivating an environment where they develop skills in critical thinking and relationship-building, and expertise in responsible AI.

To accomplish this, we seek students from communities that have been excluded in the AI space. Then we help them build identity in the field, and tap into their own agency and initiative as they build technical and leadership skills. While all are welcome to apply, AI4ALL prioritizes students whose race, gender, or ethnicity has been historically excluded from AI: Black, Hispanic and Latinx, and Indigenous folks; and women and non-binary folks. Our programs run in partnership with colleges and universities around North America.

We are launching the diverse next generation of AI changemakers through education, ethics, and relationship-driven networks. AI4ALL has received funding from Melinda Gates/Pivotal Ventures, Prudential Financial, Accenture, General Motors, and SoftBank among others and has been featured in the New York Times, TIME, CNN, The Washington Post, USA Today, and The Atlantic.

ELIGIBILITY: Must be at least 18 years of age. Must be a U.S. citizen.

Activity/project background

Since 2013, Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Hidalgo (UAEH)’s Language Center has designed resources for English language instruction. These resources include printed books and an online platform that provides students with practice exercises to improve reading comprehension and vocabulary. The undergraduate language book series consists of six levels. The platform is divided into two sections: general English and professional or technical English.

The UAEH Language Center is redesigning its language program by applying an approach to achieve dual objectives for the mastery of the English language and the development of soft and hard skills for undergraduate students in the fields of social sciences, basic sciences and engineering, arts, health sciences, agricultural and environmental sciences, economics, and administration.

The UAEH Language Center is requesting the support of a Virtual Service Pilot Participant (VSPP) to collaboratively redesign and create English language teaching and learning materials that align with the new dual objective approach. The VSPP will share their knowledge and expertise regarding the development of hard and soft skills, such as grammar rules, vocabulary, spelling, and punctuation, active listening, clear articulation, public speaking, persuasive communication, and adapting communication style to different audiences.

The UAEH Language Center has previously collaborated with the Peace Corps. They understand that the role of a VSPP is very different than that of a two-year Volunteer.

About The Job
Depart On

January 16, 2026 

Duration

2 years, plus 3 months training 

ELIGIBILITY: Must be at least 18 years of age. Must be a U.S. citizen.

Project description

In August 2018, Peace Corps was invited to establish a program in Montenegro. At the request of the Government of Montenegro, the program focuses on English Education and Youth Engagement. This program is managed and supported by Peace Corps Albania and Montenegro staff in both Podgorica, Montenegro and Tirana, Albania.

Volunteers selected to depart in 2026 will be the fourth group of Peace Corps Volunteers to serve in communities across Montenegro. Volunteers will depart for service and train together with other Volunteers who will serve in Albania. Medical and training support, as well as overall leadership of the Montenegro program, will be provided from Tirana, Albania. Therefore, at times Volunteers will have to cross borders and travel to Albania for trainings or medical appointments.

Service in Montenegro will have the additional challenge of navigating greater levels of ambiguity than service in a long-established program. This cohort will help Peace Corps further learn what it means to be a Volunteer in Montenegro and build a stronger program. The individuals selected should have demonstrated high levels of initiative and resilience, strong communication skills, and the ability to work well with various stakeholders, including community members, school faculty, and Peace Corps staff.

Volunteers will mostly be assigned to primary (K-9) schools, although some may be placed in high-schools, and will co-teach with one or more Montenegrin English teachers. As an English Education Educator, you will work alongside your teacher counterpart, whether it be for lesson planning or co-teaching in the classroom. In other words, you are expected to act in accordance with the professional standards followed by the teaching staff at your placement school. This includes arriving at work on time, attending staff meetings, and contributing to a full teaching schedule five days per week. Volunteers normally work full school days, Monday through Friday. Depending on the school, teaching shifts may vary. Volunteers will use their time at school for either teaching or planning, but certain activities such as camps or community projects may take place before or after school, or on weekends.

Your work will focus on improving the English language skills of students and teachers and introducing new teaching techniques to teachers. You will cultivate other non-traditional learning events such as English clubs or other activities which promote the speaking of English before or after regular school hours. The Montenegrin school year runs from September through June with breaks around the end-of-year holidays. All Volunteers must adhere to the local school calendar and its holiday schedule as it relates to their primary role. During the summer, you will engage in locally prioritized projects in youth development by implementing activities in your community such as camps or other student-centered events.

Patience, flexibility and good humor will be essential, as all aspects of the program design, training, and operations are relatively new. During the first three months of training, you will receive instruction primarily in the Montenegrin language. You are expected to fully commit to learning and practicing language skills, as language is an essential element of successful Volunteer service. For those placed in Albanian communities in Montenegro, an Albanian and Montenegrin language teacher will be provided in service.

Beyond the classroom, you will work towards Peace Corps goals two and three by living and spending time in your Montenegrin community with your host family and community partners. These goals are of great significance to Peace Corps’ work in Montenegro, especially when considering the United States’ complicated role in the Balkans during the 1990s. Earning the trust of the Montenegrin people will be critical to your success as a Peace Corps Volunteer."

January 16, 2026 

Duration

2 years, plus 3 months training 

ELIGIBILITY: Must be at least 18 years of age. Must be a U.S. citizen.

Project description

Albania is a dynamic country that has seen significant change over the last several decades since its transition from communism. Albania’s natural resources, and strategic location at the Western edge of the Balkan peninsula, has allowed for rapid development in some sectors. However, this growth has not been distributed equally across communities, as demonstrated by a growing wealth gap, and many communities in need of services better tailored to meet local needs.

English Language education has become apriority as Albania strives to join the European Union (EU). English language is in high demand by students and parents alike, as it is the language that creates enormous study, work, and partnership opportunities. The English Language Education program, through the work of the Volunteers, especially in rural communities, directly addresses English teachers’ professional development needs related to language proficiency and instructional procedure aligned with communicative teaching methods.

As an English Language Educator, you will be assigned to a school to teach and co-teach English as a foreign language at the middle or combined middle and high school level. Through your work with teachers and students, you will help increase English language proficiency and self-confidence. In addition to classroom teaching, you may organize clubs and camps, initiate and support youth development efforts, help develop student government in schools, share English language resources, develop teaching materials with local teachers, and become involved in locally identified community and school-based projects.

Through co-teaching alongside an Albanian English teacher, you will support and enhance the existing English language program with active-learning methodologies. You will teach upwards of eighteen 45-minute classes per week. After the first year of co-teaching, you may gradually progress to teaching on your own. You may also spend part of your time working with teachers from neighboring village schools to help improve their English and enhance their teaching techniques. You will have the opportunity to conduct teacher development workshops through collaboration with partner organizations and education offices. Volunteers also work with teachers and counterparts to improve the critical-thinking and problem-solving skills of students, often through after-school activities or English clubs.

Once you are grounded in your community, you will have ample opportunity to conduct other school and community development projects. The types of projects you may collaborate with community members on will depend on local needs and resources, which you will work to identify together. They may include, but are not limited to, improving the overall quality of life in rural areas, strengthening the education practices, facilitating youth development efforts/activities through schools or non-governmental Organizations (NGOs), identifying income-generating opportunities, and managing natural resources.

English Language Educators are placed in communities throughout Albania, excluding the capital city of Tirana. Most Volunteers will live in rural areas or small towns; however, Volunteers may be placed in a few of the larger towns where foreign language schools or professional development networks are located."

This is a fully remote, asynchronous teaching role that emphasizes student support, feedback, and mentorship rather than live instruction.

Parental and Student Communication: Act as the primary point of contact for both parents and students in academic matters in your subject area, ensuring a constructive channel of communication.
School Community Engagement: Actively participate in school initiatives and contribute to the creation and implementation of school-wide academic policies. Lead or contribute to an extracurricular club or activity that aligns with your expertise or passion.

MOHS Teachers are expected to maintain five (5) hours during school days, Monday through Friday, between 8 am and 4 pm in a US timezone (ET, CT, MT, or PT) for office hours, student meetings, and other school activities.
A significant portion of the work such as grading can otherwise be completed outside of school hours.




Requirements

At least 3 years of full-time experience teaching grades 9-12
Bachelor’s degree in English, Secondary Education, or related field
Strong written and verbal communication skills
Ability to work independently in a remote setting
Excellent organizational and multitasking skills
Tech-savvy with an ability to learn new platforms quickly, such as gradebooks, Google Classroom, curriculum platforms, and Google Suite
Proficiency in (or willingness to learn) responsible use of AI tools to increase efficiency in the education sector




The ideal candidate brings:

Online teaching experience (nice to have but not required!)




Compensation & Benefits

The expected starting pay range is $24.03 - $37.34 per hour. Miaplaza’s compensation philosophy ensures equity and competitiveness while considering the regional differences in living and labor costs. Specific rates will be provided during the hiring process and are aligned with market data and internal equity.

Want to teach part-time and remotely? Join the Elevate K-12 Teacher network! We are hiring teachers certified in the U.S. for English Language Arts for grades 3-12 for the 2024-2025 school year.

We offer... 


1099 contract position – no benefits provided, or taxes withheld 
Elevate teachers are paid an hourly rate for all teaching time PLUS guaranteed additional pay for administrative tasks outside of the classroom. We add these two together to create an effective pay rate per classroom teaching hour. The final effective rate is dependent on a variety of factors, including state, subject, grade level, curriculum, and more. Our English Language Arts teachers are paid the following:
Grades 3 - 12 earns $28.80 - $33.80 per teaching hour
Part-time hours (generally 10-20 teaching hours/week for teachers allocated to classes) 
Choose your own schedule – daily sub and long-term sub opportunities for the rest of the 2024-2025 school year
Fully remote – teach from home! 


Who We Are...

Elevate K-12 is an EdTech company, and we are on a mission to ensure every student receives a high-quality education, regardless of zip code. We are changing the way classrooms work by creating a brand-new category of LIVE, virtual classroom instruction that gives students access to exceptional, certified, live teachers. Using our proprietary technology, our teachers are livestreamed from across the country into thousands of classrooms, providing instruction that would otherwise be unavailable in many districts across the US. Our goal is to enable high-quality, live teaching for every learner.

About Elevate K-12 LIVE Teaching...

It is just like a regular class, except it is LIVE. We livestream U.S. certified teachers who are teaching remotely into public school classrooms across the country (the students are not remote or homeschooled). When students head into a live classroom, they will feel like it is a regular school day – teachers asking questions, students raising their hands, all made possible by our technology and teachers. Elevate LIVE teaching was built to act, look, feel, and sound like every other classroom.

Every classroom has a Classroom Coach – the adult in the room to help with classroom management, keeping kids on task, and partnering together with the teacher. Our technology platform was built for K-12 students to facilitate effective, engaging instruction. We also have a 24/7 support network for teachers and schools if issues arise.

Benefits To Teaching With Elevate...

Our teaching network allows teachers to teach on their own terms! This means part-time hours on schedules you create and the ability to work from home (or any other professional setting). We take away many of the excess burdens that teachers typically shoulder (no more lunch duty) and provide teachers with an engaging curriculum (through Elevate or our district partners), a supportive team, and a tech platform that empowers teachers to focus on teaching.


Fully remote (private and professional setting required) 
Part-time hours during the regular school day (choose your own schedule) 
Reduced administrative duties (no staff meetings or lunch duties) 
Individualized instructional coaching to hone teaching skills 
Professional development opportunities 
Networking and fun with your fellow teachers! 
Reach deserving students across the country, and provide them opportunities to learn 


Our expectations of Elevate teachers...


Adaptable in taking classes that start throughout the semester – most teachers teach between 10-20 hours per week, building up to that schedule throughout the year 
Commitment and consistency in attendance - Elevate teachers are the teacher of record for their students 
Maintain an elevated level of professionalism in the classroom environment with students, the Classroom Coach, fellow Elevate K-12 professionals, and school employees 
Flexible, can think critically, and can adapt to change quickly to ensure optimal student outcomes 
Ability to meet deadlines set by Elevate and the school calendar 
Tech-savvy and comfortable operating in a remote setting 
Can maintain an elevated level of online organizational and professional skills 
Consistently reliable internet connection and an appropriate, professional environment for teaching 


Mandatory Requirements... 


Most importantly... a passion for remarkable teaching! 
An active, verifiable teaching certification in the United States for:
English Language Arts
Certified and experienced with teaching students in grades 3 - 12. 
Willing to accept substitute opportunities for the rest of the 2024-2025 school year. 
A bachelor's degree from an accredited university or college 
A daily available time block of at least three consecutive hours, Monday through Friday, 8am - 4pm EST. 
Ability to work a part-time schedule of 10-20 hours per week during normal school hours 
A laptop or desktop computer with a reliable high-speed internet connection


At Elevate, we treat teachers like the educated professionals they are. We empower our network of teachers to choose which classes they want to teach, when (and how much) they want to work, and where they want to log in – while being empowered to teach LIVE in classrooms across the country. Become an Elevate teacher, and finally take control of your work/life harmony!

Elevate K-12 is a creative, challenging, and adventurous network where individuals and teams are driven by growth, collaboration, and the goal to constantly focus on our students' needs. But through all of this, we always remember why we’re here: to teach!

ELIGIBILITY: Must be at least 18 years of age. Must be a U.S. citizen.

Project description

The Dominican Republic’s economy benefits from the hospitality and tourism industry, making English speakers highly attractive in the labor market. Many Dominicans dream of travelling abroad and participating in international academic exchange programs. Speaking English enables Dominicans to diversify their future opportunities for better salaries, which in turn will improve the quality of life of young people and their families.

The Ministry of Education is promoting a new educational model called “English for a Better Life” (“Inglés para Vivir Mejor”) as part of its national strategic plan and hopes to ensure that young people at the pre-university level leave public schools with mastery of two languages, both English and Spanish. The first step is to “strengthen the teaching staff in the linguistic skills and pedagogical skills necessary to provide quality education in English.”

The goal of this program is to support the Ministry of Education by working with middle school teachers, students, and community members to develop their English communication skills and thus, improve their access academic, professional, and personal development opportunities. The Dominican school week is Monday through Friday and Volunteers are expected to be in their assigned school 20-30 hours per week with their co-teachers planning and facilitating classes and supporting classroom management. The schools where Volunteers will work have multiple and varying needs which offers Volunteers the ability to use their skills and interests to teach and serve the overall community through extracurricular and non-formal activities such as English clubs, after-schools sports, theatre, or art clubs.

The Volunteer’s primary assignment will be to serve as a resource for school staff (including the principal, teachers, librarian, counselor, and/or academic coordinator), students and families. Specifically, Volunteers will work with English teachers to integrate innovative teaching practices into the classroom, with students to improve their English speaking and reading skills, and with families to strengthen their involvement in education. Work will involve modeling and/or co-teaching strategies, improving classroom management skills, sharing teaching practices, developing teaching materials, tutoring students, and involving families in English language learning."

Each EQ office aims to improve education coverage rates, implement national education plans, and strengthen both school management and teacher training to enhance student education.

The Undersecretary of Education is requesting the support of a Virtual Service Pilot Participant (VSPP) to co-train teachers on new pedagogical strategies that can be implemented across schools to develop the socio-emotional skills and personal entrepreneurial competencies of students ages 15-17. They also seek support in co-developing workshops on (1) seeking opportunities, (2) persistence, (3) work commitments, (4) risk taking, (5) demand for efficiency and quality, (6) goal setting, (7) seeking information, (8) systematic planning and monitoring, (9) persuasion and networking, and (10) self-confidence.

The Undersecretary of Educational Development of Atlántico has previously collaborated with the Peace Corps and understands that the role of a VSPP is very different than a two-year Volunteer.

March 14, 2026 

Duration

2 years, plus 3 months training 

Overview

Project description

Launched in 2010, The English Education project is a collaborative initiative between the Peace Corps and the Ministry of Public Education (MEP). Volunteers play a crucial role in working with elementary students (grades 1-6) nationwide, collaborating with teachers, and offering support inside and outside the classroom.

Costa Rica boasts over 4,000 elementary schools, offering diverse private and public sector modalities. The English Education project primarily collaborates with tuition-free public sector which includes Rural, Technical, Academic, Scientific, and Bilingual schools. Some communities offer tuition-paid private schools; however Peace Corps doesn't operate within these institutions.

The education system has four levels: preschool, elementary, secondary, and higher. Basic General Education, (compulsory and free) spans six years of elementary school and five or six years of secondary school. Students leave elementary school at an average age of 12 or 13.

Objectives


 Increase teachers’ general and English teaching skills.
 Enhance teachers’ practices in the classroom.
 Improve the English proficiency of English teachers.
 Boost students' achievement in English.
 Strengthen the ability of community members to support students' access to learning.


Focus And Approach

The project centers on capacity-building through one-on-one relationships with teachers, school staff, and community members. These relationships are vital for impactful co-teaching and co-planning of regular English classes and extracurricular activities. As students’ progress, typically from the third grade onward, the curriculum covers more advanced topics. Core subjects include Spanish, natural sciences, mathematics, social studies, English, as well as complementary subjects (arts, physical education, life skills, and religion). Volunteers will provide tailored support for English proficiency designed to align with the specific requirements of each subject, ensuring a holistic and enriching educational experience.

Expectations For Volunteers


 Work full-time under a structured schedule with elementary students and teachers within a school population of 100 to 800 students.
 Assist counterparts in organizing schedules for co-planning and co-teaching lessons.
 Overcome challenges, including geographic, climatic, cultural, and socio-economic factors, to integrate into rural, under-resourced communities.
 Adapt to Peace Corps and counterparts’ norms and procedures during training, meetings, recreational activities, and teaching in formal and informal classroom settings.


Jackson’s Experience

EXAMPLES OF CURRENT VOLUNTEER ACTIVITIES:


 Jackson has never had a “routine” day. He walks 30 minutes to school each morning, where his main activities include collaborating with his school counterparts. When he’s not co-leading the English classroom, Jackson tutors individuals or small groups. He also gets to work one-on-one with special education students. Outside the school, he co-leads civic events in the community, supports fundraising efforts, and some days rolls up his sleeves to help the cafeteria. While there is no routine for Jackson, each day brings interesting challenges and pleasant rewards.


Quenten’s Experience


 Quenten serves in a semi-urban area just 50 minutes from the capital. They start their day at 6:45 AM in the school, co-teaching two lessons. Afterwards, the cooks provide breakfast (pinto beans and eggs). At times, they juggle four lessons in the morning with an hour break before lunch. During break, they prepare tutoring materials for the students and the educators, while also planning the next summer camp, followed by five more lessons in the afternoon before they end at 5 PM. Quenten gets in a workout at the gym before heading home for dinner. Often dinner is prepared by their host family, other times they cook together with the family."

January 11, 2026 

Duration

2 years, plus 3 months training 

ELIGIBILITY: Must be at least 18 years of age. Must be a U.S. citizen.

Project description

Akwaaba! (Welcome!) Volunteers in Ghana will serve in a stable democracy with a rich history and hospitable and diverse cultures. Ghana recognizes over 70 languages and tribes throughout the sixteen regions, all of whom co-exist harmoniously. Welcoming visitors is a point of cultural identity; Hosting visitors is the ultimate expression of Ghanaian culture. Acknowledging the presence of another human being by greeting them, honors their existence. In the local communities, visitors will be welcomed into families and quickly be made to feel at home. Ghana is Peace Corps’ oldest post, hosting volunteers since the Agency’s first cohort departed in 1961.

Skills

The Deaf Education program is integrated into the Education project and the goal of the Education project is for students to gain skills in math, science, and art to advance in their academic careers. Deaf Education Teachers in the education sector will work collaboratively with counterparts and the communities to increase:


 Achievement of students in STEAM (science, math, and/or art).
 Students’ literacy skills.
 The ability of community members to support students’ access to learning.
 Capacity of teachers to use girls' empowerment practices in the classroom.


In addition to these Education program goals, Deaf Education Volunteers partner with school colleagues to develop vocational and technical skills.

The Ghana Deaf Education program focuses on the Schools for the Deaf in Ghana. Despite a relatively large Deaf population in Ghana, there is still very little awareness about Deaf culture and extremely high levels of stigmatization. Volunteers work with students at the primary and junior high school levels to introduce critical thinking activities by instructing students in various disciplines. Volunteers also work with students in after school programs, organizing and running clubs, games and sports, and tutoring.

Teachers teach on average 24 periods per week. Each period lasts 45 minutes and each grade is expected to receive an average of 45 periods of instruction a week covering all subjects (nine periods a day for all subjects). Class sizes range from about 20 students to 45 or more. Students' ages can range from 12 to 23 years old. You will be responsible for teaching the subject assigned to you, developing lesson plans, teaching classes, giving assignments, grading homework and tests, and assisting students outside of the classroom.

Peace Corps/Ghana promotes girls’ education and empowerment. You will receive training on challenges in Ghana and you will have the opportunity to implement activities that are contextually appropriate. During your service, you will look for ways to work with community members to increase girls’ sense of agency. As part of your work, you will also report on these efforts and their impact. Volunteers receive training on how to tell success stories and report numeric/statistical data to Peace Corps."

Project description

At the request of the Government of Nepal, Peace Corps Nepal launched its English Education Project in February 2019 placing Volunteers in government schools with Nepali counterparts to teach English in grades 4-8. The English Education Project focus areas are:


 Increasing the capacity of teachers to use general and English teaching skills more effectively
 Increasing the capacity of teachers to use gender-equitable practices in the classroom
 Increasing the English proficiency of English teachers (as measured through use of classroom English)
 Increasing achievement of students in English
 Increasing the ability of community members to support students’ access to learning


Volunteers will partner with Nepali teachers and have the opportunity to both co-teach and teach independently. Volunteers and Nepali teachers will engage in ongoing exchange so they can identify, implement, and reflect on effective classroom practices, activities and experiences. Volunteers work together with their counterparts, teachers, and committed community members to build capacity of the school.

Building relationships and gaining the trust of school leadership, teachers, and students will allow for the exploration, and implementation of new best practices for English as a Foreign Language.

Your Role 

We're looking for an enthusiastic, dedicated Lead Teacher (Guide) to support a mixed-age class of preschool age children in a Montessori environment. 

In a Montessori class, guides (teachers) carefully prepare an environment that fosters independence and captivates a child’s interest. Guides provide personalized support to each child. They work with children individually and in small groups, demonstrating how to use the materials and perform activities with them, and giving precise language to understand their experiences. 

Because of the carefully prepared environment and individualized support, children in a Montessori class have tremendous liberty to explore the environment and work on materials of their choice for as long as they want. Most importantly, the support and materials help every child develop skills, confidence, and a firm conviction that they are capable. 

We’re looking for a Lead Teacher who will bring their best in order to support every child in reaching their highest potential! 

Children’s House Lead Guides ( Preschool Teacher): 


Observe each child closely to understand and meet their physical, intellectual, and emotional needs

Form personal connections with each child and cultivate a community of respect 
Communicate and collaborate respectfully with parents to provide the best possible support for every child 


The Montessori Prepared Environment 

Every classroom at Guidepost comes equipped with the full range of high-quality Montessori materials for the Children’s House curriculum, as well as a budget for guides to personalize their space. Each classroom is set up according to the Montessori principles of beauty and order and is designed to enable every child to learn, concentrate, and confidently achieve their independence. 

A Guidepost Montessori Children’s House space features: 


Child-sized furniture and ample floor space for children to work independently or in small groups 
Practical life materials for children to sweep, set the table, dust, prepare meals, and so much more 
Curriculum for independence: in dressing themselves, feeding themselves, caring for the space etc. 
Scientifically designed, hands-on learning materials for gaining core knowledge in math, literacy, science, and so much more 
All materials made accessible to children on low shelves and all art at the child’s level 
Cozy reading areas, real plants, and plenty of natural light 
Breakable objects made from natural materials like wood, metal, and glass rather than plastic 


If you’re passionate about giving children the tools they need to succeed, eager to partner with parents on their child’s journey, and longing to join a collaborative community of peers, then the team at Guidepost Montessori would love to hear from you! 

An ideal candidate has: 


Obtained or willing to obtain a Montessori diploma for 3-6 
Experience working with children ages 3-6 in a group setting such as daycare, aftercare, or preschool 
Familiarity with child-led philosophies such as Reggio Emilia or Montessori and/or open to learning more! 


What we offer: 


The opportunity to contribute to a high-quality Montessori program that serves the individual needs of each child 
Sponsored Montessori diploma and ongoing professional development through the Prepared Montessorian Institute 
75% tuition discount for two children at any school in our network (we serve children from 3-months-old through 12th grade)

The position also builds community capacity to improve access and availability of affordable, safe and culturally appropriate, nutritious foods and beverages, such as through gardening initiatives. In collaboration with many organizations and the 7 federally-recognized tribal organizations in Virginia – Pamunkey Indian Tribe, Chickahominy, Eastern Chickahominy, Upper Mattaponi, Rappahannock, Nansemond and Monacan - the Virginia Family Nutrition Program aims to help reduce the risk of nutrition insecurity and chronic disease by working with indigenous adults to gain practical skills that result in changed behaviors to shop smart, eat smart, and move more.

The individual in this position will recruit, enroll, and teach adult participants individually or in group settings (in-person, by phone, or using video conferencing) about basic principles of food resource management, food preparation, nutrition, and physical activity.

This position involves collaborating with federal tribal organizations, agencies, and organizations that work with indigenous persons with limited resources, marketing the program, and collecting evaluation records for all programs.

The Family Nutrition Program Educator (Indigenous Initiatives) is an employee and representative of Virginia Cooperative Extension and works under the supervision of the Coordinator for Indigenous Health. The person in this position is expected to travel regionally to provide in-person programs and build community partnerships within Indigenous communities with a primary focus of supporting tribal traditions, culture, beliefs, and food sovereignty initiatives.

Required Qualifications


 Bachelor’s degree in nutrition or public health-related field from an accredited university or college
 Experience planning and implementing programs

We take care of all the administrative work so you can do what you do best: inspire learning and creating the next generation of musicians!

Teach music lessons to students of varying ages and skill levels.

Build positive relationships with students and parents through regular communication, goal-setting, and progress updates.

About Music & Arts


Music & Arts embodies the world of creativity and music by encouraging our teammates to find their own individual sound. We strive to create lifelong musicians and make a difference in the world by enabling musicians and non-musicians alike to experience the almost indescribable happiness that comes from playing an instrument. We believe in putting our customers first, engaging with respect and integrity and fulfilling our mission with passion.
The first Music & Arts was located in a small house in Bethesda, MD and run by founder Benjamin O'Brien. When Music & Arts opened its doors in 1952, we offered printed music, music lessons, dance lessons, and art supplies. Ben decided shortly after opening his business that he wanted to focus on music to better serve his customers -- a decision that remains intact to this day.
Since the 1990's, Music & Arts has expanded nationwide through organic growth and a series of acquisitions and mergers with other music dealers. In 2005, Music & Arts joined forces with American Music to become the largest band and orchestra instrument retailer in the United States. Based in Frederick, MD, Music & Arts is now part of the Guitar Center enterprise and comprises 225+ retail stores, 200+ educational representatives, and 250+ affiliate locations.


Why Music & Arts? Here's just some of the rewards:
For our employees who are musicians we offer the unique opportunity of gig leave--take time off to share your music with the world and return to your job after your tour! Music & Arts offers robust benefits and perks, including Medical, Dental, Vision, 401K plus company match, mental health support, paid sick/holiday/vacation time, employee discount program, and tuition reimbursement options.
The job posting is not necessarily reflective of actual compensation that may be earned, nor a promise of any specific pay for any specific employee, which is always dependent on actual experience, education, and other factors.

We believe in putting our customers first, engaging with respect and integrity and fulfilling our mission with passion.
The first Music & Arts was located in a small house in Bethesda, MD and run by founder Benjamin O'Brien. When Music & Arts opened its doors in 1952, we offered printed music, music lessons, dance lessons, and art supplies.

Since the 1990's, Music & Arts has expanded nationwide through organic growth and a series of acquisitions and mergers with other music dealers. In 2005, Music & Arts joined forces with American Music to become the largest band and orchestra instrument retailer in the United States.

We are now hiring a Lead Toddler Teacher for our beautiful Guidepost Montessori school at North Chesterfield in Richmond!

Get the opportunity to nurture Toddlers with an environment designed for their growth, exploration, and independence!

Your Role

We're looking for an enthusiastic, dedicated Lead Guide (Teacher) to support a mixed-age class of toddler age children in a Montessori environment.

In a Montessori community, guides (teachers) carefully prepare an environment that fosters independence and captivates a child’s interest. Guides provide personalized support to each child. They work with children individually and in small groups, demonstrating how to use the materials and perform activities with them, and giving precise language to understand their experiences.

Because of the carefully prepared environment and individualized support, children in a Montessori class have tremendous liberty to explore the environment and work on materials of their choice for as long as they want. Most importantly, the support and materials help every child develop skills, confidence, and a firm conviction that they are capable.

We’re looking for a Lead Guide who will bring their best in order to support every child in reaching their highest potential!

Guidepost Toddler Lead Guides:


Observe each child closely to understand and meet their physical, intellectual, and emotional needs 
Prepare a beautiful, orderly environment that fosters trust, exploration, deep learning, and independence
Cultivate independence and self-confidence by helping children ‘do it all by themselves’ 
Provide lessons to encourage practical life skills, language, and grace and courtesy 
Form personal connections with each child and cultivate a community of respect
Communicate and collaborate respectfully with parents to provide the best possible care for every child 


The Montessori Prepared Environment

Every classroom at Guidepost comes equipped with the full range of high-quality Montessori materials for the infant/toddler curriculum, as well as a budget for guides to personalize their space. Each classroom is set up according to the Montessori principles of beauty and order and is designed to enable every child to explore, learn, and confidently achieve their independence.

A Guidepost Montessori toddler space features:


Abundant open space to move and explore 
Child-sized furniture and objects to facilitate independence 
Curriculum for independence in: dressing themselves, feeding themselves, toilet learning etc. 
Scientifically designed learning materials to develop fine and gross motor skills and so much more 
Cozy rugs, real plants, and plenty of natural light
Breakable objects made from natural materials like wood, metal, and glass rather than plastic
Objects to climb, crawl over, and explore instead of baby-holding devices like walkers and highchairs 


If you’re passionate about giving children the tools they need to succeed, eager to partner with parents on their child’s journey, and longing to join a collaborative community of peers, then the team at Guidepost Montessori would love to hear from you!

An ideal candidate has:


Are interested in pursuing certified Montessori training through our Prepared Montessorian Institute (fully-sponsored) or have previously obtained a Montessori diploma
Experience working with children ages 0-3 in a group setting such as daycare, aftercare, or nursery 
Familiarity with child-led philosophies such as Reggio Emilia or Montessori and/or open to learning more! 
Earned a Bachelor’s Degree (any subject in Education) 


What we offer:


The opportunity to contribute to a high-quality Montessori program that serves the individual needs of each child 
Sponsored Montessori diploma and ongoing professional development through the Prepared Montessorian Institute 
75% tuition discount for two children at any school in our network (we serve children from 3-months-old through 12th grade)
A network of supportive peers and mentors who appreciate your valuable contributions and regularly share best practices 
Abundant career growth and promotion opportunities
A competitive salary
Health, dental, and vision insurance
Paid time off and paid holidays 


About Us

And with schools from Shanghai to Paris and California to New York, as well as virtual school and homeschooling support, there are countless opportunities for passionate educators to support children on their individual path to success.

At Guidepost, we believe children are capable and we design an education for independence. We’re on a mission to radically transform education based on this belief—for children, parents, and educators!

Our mission? Children who fully experience and joyfully achieve their own development; children who can reach their highest potential and flourish—in school and in life!

If you love children and have been looking for the right opportunity to grow, join our school community by applying below!

Higher Ground Education, Guidepost Montessori, and Academy of Thought and Industry are committed to a policy of Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO). We will not discriminate on the basis of age, sex, race, color, creed, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, national origin, alienage or citizenship, disability, marital status, military or veteran status, or any other legally recognized protected basis under applicable federal, state or local laws, regulations or ordinances.

Delivery Augmenting Materials: Integrate enrichment components like technical interview prep workshops and promote use of CodePath’s Career Center resources 
Outreach: Partner with Campus Outreach teams to support and promote CodePath courses through on-campus engagement initiatives

We are now hiring a Lead Infant Teacher for our lovely Guidepost Montessori school North Chesterfield!

Get the opportunity to nurture infants with an environment designed for their growth, exploration, and independence!

Salary is $38,000+

Your Role

We're looking for an enthusiastic, dedicated Lead Guide (Teacher) to support a mixed-age class of infant age children in a Montessori environment.

In a Montessori community, guides (teachers) carefully prepare an environment that fosters independence and captivates a child’s interest. Guides provide personalized support to each child. They work with children individually and in small groups, demonstrating how to use the materials and perform activities with them, and giving precise language to understand their experiences.

Because of the carefully prepared environment and individualized support, children in a Montessori class have tremendous liberty to explore the environment and work on materials of their choice for as long as they want. Most importantly, the support and materials help every child develop skills, confidence, and a firm conviction that they are capable.

We’re looking for a Lead Guide who will bring their best in order to support every child in reaching their highest potential!

Guidepost Infant Lead Guides:


Observe each child closely to understand and meet their physical, intellectual, and emotional needs 
Follow the natural rhythms of sleeping, eating, and toileting for each child
Prepare a beautiful, orderly environment that fosters trust, exploration, deep learning, and independence
Cultivate independence and self-confidence by helping children ‘do it all by themselves’ 
Form personal connections with each child and cultivate a community of respect
Communicate and collaborate respectfully with parents to provide the best possible care for every child 


The Montessori Prepared Environment

Every classroom at Guidepost comes equipped with the full range of high-quality Montessori materials for the infant/toddler curriculum, as well as a budget for guides to personalize their space. Each classroom is set up according to the Montessori principles of beauty and order and is designed to enable every child to explore, learn, and confidently achieve their independence.

A Guidepost Montessori infant space features:
